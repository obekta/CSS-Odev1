      <h2 style="text-align:center ;">POKEMONS</h2>
      <ol style="text-align:center">
        <li>Arbok</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/024.png" alt="Arbok">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Arbok is not a favourite pokemon for most Pokemon fans but I think it is a cool Pokemon even though it is on the side of the bad guys. As you can guess it is a poison-type snake-like Pokemon that is from Generation-1. It evolves from Ekans starting at level 22.
          </p>
        <li>Scyther</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/123.png" alt="Scyhter">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Scyther is probably a more likeable Pokemon than Arbok which is again from Generation-1. It is a bug-type Pokemon that evolves into Scizor when traded while holding a Metal Coat (from Generations 2 to 7). It also evolves into Kleavor as another final form when exposed to a Black Augurite.   
          </p>
        <li>Dodrio</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/085.png" alt="dodrio">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Like Arbok, Dodrio is also probably not a favourite Pokemon for most people. However, I think with its three heads and ostrich-like look makes it a good looking Pokemon. It is also stronger than a lot of people know. Dodrio is a normal/flying-type Pokemon and it evolves from Dodue starting at level 31.        
          </p>
        <li>Articuno</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/144.png" alt="Articuno">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Articuno is one of the three legendary birds (others are being Zapdos and Moltres) from the Generation-1 as you all know. It has a really cool look with crystal blue color and its long tail. It is an extremely powerful ice/flying-type Pokemon. It also has a Galarian form that is a psychic/flying-type that has a purple-like color. Articuno is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon.    
          </p>
        <li>Wailord</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/321.png" alt="Wailord">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Wailord is the first Pokemon that I only know through games (and not watched) among the Pokemons that I mentioned so far. It is a huge whale-like Pokemon from Generation-3 that is also powerful and I think this makes it likeable. It evolves from Wailmer sarting at level 40. 
          </p>
        <li>Raikou</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/243.png" alt="Raikou">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Raikou is one of the three legendary beasts that resurrected by Ho-Oh after burning of the Brass Tower. Raikou is said to represent the lightning strike which ignited the fire that consumed the tower (<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Burned_Tower">More info here</a>). It is an electric-type Pokemon with a tiger-like look and it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon.
          </p>
        <li>Seviper</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/336.png" alt="Seviper">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Seviper is another poison-type (from Gen-3) and snake-like Pokemon like Arbok and again it is not one favourite Pokemons for most people. And again I think it has a cool look with his different looking head, tooth and tail. Seviper is known his rivalry with another Pokemon called Zangoose. 
          </p>
        <li>Ninetales</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/038.png" alt="Ninetales">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Ninetales is a beautiful fire-type Pokemon from Generation-1. It evolves from another beautiful Pokemon Vulpix when exposed to a Fire Stone. Moreover, it has an Alolan form that is an ice/fairy-type Pokemon.
          </p>
        <li>Onix</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/095.png" alt="Onix">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Onix is another powerful Pokemon from Generation-1. It is another snake-like Pokemon that I am sure has much more fans than the other ones. It is a rock/ground-type Pokemon that evolves into Steelix when traded while holding a Metal Coat (from Generations 2 to 7) or when exposed to a Metal Coat (<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Legends:_Arceus">Pokemon Legends: Arceus</a>)   
          </p>
        <li>Rayquaza</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/384.png" alt="Rayquaza">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Rayquaza is a dragon/flying-type legendary Pokemon from Generation-3. Along with Kyogre and Groudon, Rayquaza is one of the super-ancient Pokemon,serving as the group's trio master. It can mega evolve into Mega Rayquaza which is extremely powerful if it knows Dragon Ascent.
          </p>
        <li>Dragonite</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/149.png" alt="Dragonite">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            I know that Dragonite had to be in this list. Most people probably became a fan of it after watching its mysterios debut as a giant one (<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP013">Ep.13</a>). Dragonite is a dragon/flying pseudo-legendary Pokemon from Generation-1 that is again extremely powerful. It evolves from Dragonair starting at level 55 and it is the final form of Dratini.
          </p>
        <li>Giratina</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/487.png" alt="Giratina">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Giratina is a scary looking ghost/dragon-type legendary Pokemon. I also know this Pokemon only from the games but it was enough for me to like it! It has another forme as "Origin Forme" that is activated by giving it a Griseous Orb to hold or by using Griseous Core on it. The original forme is called  "Altered Forme". Giratina is a member of the creation trio of Sinnoh (with Dialga and Palkia), representing antimatter. 
          </p>
        <li>Salamence</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/373.png" alt="Salamence">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Salamence is another good-looking and strong Pokemon from Generation-3. It is a dragon/flying pseudo-legendary Pokemon and it evolves from Shelgon starting at level 50. It is the final form of Bagon. Salamence can also mega evolve ino Mega Salamence using the Salamencite.
          </p>
        <li>Tyranitar</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/248.png" alt="Tyranitar">  
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Tyranitar is another pseudo-legendary Pokemon from Generation-2. It is rock/dark-type Pokemon that looks like a dinosaur. It evolves from Pupitar that does not look like a strong Pokemon (even though Tyranitar is very powerful) starting at level 55. It can also mega evolve into Mega Tyranitar using the Tyranitarite. 
          </p>
        <li>Gyadaros</li>
          <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/130.png" alt="Gyadaros">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            Gyarados is another candidate to being a fan-favourite with its appearances in Generation-1. It was a big surprise for everyone when a little fish Pokemon Magikarp evolved into one of the strongest Pokemons of the Generation-1. It is a water/flying-type Pokemon with an ability to mega evolve using Gyaradosite.
          </p>
        <li>Charizard</li>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/tr/f/f4/Charizard_Artwork.png" alt="Charizard">
          <p style="font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">
            This list was not in an order but the last Pokemon that I will mention is probably my favourite Pokemon among all the Pokemons. Charizard is another fan-favourite Pokemon that is a fire/flying-type Pokemon that looks and behaves like a dragon a lot. This strong Pokemon may not be a legendary but it is seen that it can even defeat a legendary Pokemon (<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Noland%27s_Articuno">Articuno</a>). Charizard evolves from Charmeleon starting at level 36 and it is the final form of Charmander.
